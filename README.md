## 4. Getting a SIM Card and the Students Deal
Avoid buying a SIM card from any booths at BEY Airport. Go to an official service provider like [Touch Lab](http://www.touch.com.lb/) in Downtown to get a cheap one. You can also enjoy their offers provided you're a student:
* :iphone: [Touch Student Plan](http://www.touch.com.lb/autoforms/portal/touch/about-touch/media-center/news/studentplan)
* :iphone: [Alfa Student Plan](https://www.facebook.com/aub.edu.lb/posts/dear-aub-studentswe-would-like-to-let-you-know-that-aub-students-are-now-able-to/1541334025905768/)

## 5. Currency: Value, Payment and Exchange
:heavy_dollar_sign: _$1 = 1500 LL. You can always pay with dollars and expect to get Lebanese liras in return, and vice versa._ :heavy_dollar_sign:
<br> :exclamation: Due to the current situation, this exchange rate is no longer accurate.:exclamation:
<br>On [Hamra main street](https://goo.gl/maps/Zqgik2HYeVM3TGzX6), you can find different exchange shops/kiosks that stay open til 9:00 PM.

## 6. Apartments Rental and Roommate Search
:bulb: _When looking for an appartment, ask whether the price includes internet and electricy subscription fees._ :bulb:

* :microscope: [Al Madina Pharmacy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Al+Madina+-+Pharmacy/@33.8959648,35.4798817,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x58c23027a5b8c54d?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUm8m29rnkAhVxDGMBHaLDAf4Q_BIwE3oECA4QCA)

## 9. Electricity Power Cut Schedule

* :minibus: [Campus shuttle bus schedule](http://www.aub.edu.lb/auxiliary/Documents/Bus%20stops.pdf)
### "Serveeces", Taxis and Vans
__Serveece__: It's a way to carpool; which means you take a car with up to three people. A serveece is 2000 LL, you should first stop and tell the driver about your destination, they might agree and ask you to get in, sometimes they don't; they either drive away or ask you to pay more (2 Serveeces = 4000 LL etc...) It's your choice to either take it or wait and try another one!
<br>:bulb: _Always make sure you have change before getting in a Serveece; you don't want any of them drivers arguing that they don't have enough change to return it to you._ :bulb:<br><br>
__Taxi__: You use this option when you do not want to carpool and instead, take a car just for yourself. People usually take Taxis when they're going somewhere far. Note that this option will cost you 10.000 LL or 15.000 LL to say the least (moving inside the city). Always agree on the price before getting in. Note that Taxis and Serveeces have red plates. <br><br>
__Vans__: Probably the cheapest way to move around the city. It's 1000 LL per ride.
<br>:bulb: In case you have a bicycle, that's awesome! AUB has free parking spots all around campus, but you're not allowed to bike on campus :bulb: <br>

### Going To And From The Airport
Taking a random taxi from the streets might not be the most financially convenient solution. An [Uber](https://www.uber.com/lb/ar/) from AUB to the airport will cost you $15 if you don't have a promo-code.

## 11. Transportation: Outside Beirut
The vans (defined above) take you pretty much everywhere outside Beirut. You might also want to consider other fancy bus services like Connexion, in case you're heading to the north.
* :blue_car: [Connexion Bus Service - Official Website](https://www.connexion-transport.com/)
* :blue_car: [Zawarib Map For Public Transport in Beirut](http://beirut-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/zawarib.jpg)
* :blue_car: [Interactive Bus Map](http://busmap.me)

## 12. Car Rental
If you're planning a trip such that the van service mentioned above doesn't serve you, you may want to consider renting a car. Below are deals that start from $22/day. _You must be 21+ y/o with a minimum one-year-of-validity driving license._

## 15. Sports: AUB Varsity Teams, Tryouts, and more
In addition to the free access you have to AUB's sport facilities, like the gym, green field and swimming pool, you can always try to join one (or more?) of AUB's varsity teams!
* :baseball: [AUB Varsity Teams](https://website.aub.edu.lb/sao/sports/athletics/Athletics_Teams/Pages/Athletics_Teams.aspx)
* :baseball: [AUB University Sports](https://website.aub.edu.lb/sao/sports/Pages/index.aspx)
* :baseball: For tryouts, wait to receive an email from University Sports regarding the schedule at the beginning of each semester.
* :running: [Beirut Marathon](https://www.beirutmarathon.org/)

## 16. AUB Clubs
Joining a club is one of the best ways to socialize and get to do what you love. Clubs range from being about music, sports and other hobbies, to having a political affiliation/message; so make sure you know the purpose of the club before joining it.
:heavy_dollar_sign: _The price for enrolling in a club on AUBsis can start from $10._ :heavy_dollar_sign: <br>
