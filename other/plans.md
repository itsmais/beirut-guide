## Introduction: Idea Origin	
### The idea came to my mind as I was gearing up for a mentorship program for international students at my university; I thought of a guide that could have saved both my time and the time of my mentors back in the day when I was a newly enrolled international student as well. Since I was on my own during the winter break, I decided to take advantage of the Markdown syntax, that GitHub hosts for free, to publish the [first edition](https://github.com/mais-hatem/beirut-guide/blob/master/README.md) of this guide; it’s found here and aimed at the internationals studying at my university and residing in the city of Beirut, Lebanon.

## Project Description
### This [first draft of the guide](https://github.com/mais-hatem/beirut-guide/blob/master/README.md) contains many sections; it starts with the most important one that deals with courses registration and getting the legal tasks done like residency applications and health insurances. Then, it mentions some hacks to move around the city without being dealt with as a foreigner. Lastly, it mentions the Do’s and Don’ts’s and the activities students can do for fun and cultural exposure. 

## Future Plans and Collaborations
### After sharing this work with the international students who joined my university this semester and on Reddit and other social media websites, the feedback was generally positive and almost everyone emphasized the need of having the same guide but for other universities in Lebanon, and then the region. 
### As someone who comes from an Arab background, I believe that exchange doesn’t only happen in one direction; to Europe or the US necessarily. I’ve met many people who are interested in the East and come here to learn more about the culture or actually study the language.
### _My plan is to collaborate with the universities here to accommodate all those foreigners who plan to spend a semester or more in the Middle East._ It can start as a web page designated for each university, but with the employment of effective technology like chatbots, I believe we can boost the students’ experience to a whole new level.
